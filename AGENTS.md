# AI Agents Context & Rules

## Workflow Rules
1.  **Commit & Push**: You must commit and push changes after achieving every significant milestone (e.g., finishing a feature, completing setup, refactoring a module).
2.  **Milestones**: A milestone is defined as a completed unit of work that leaves the codebase in a stable state.

## Project Structure
-   `player/`: Player agent code and config.
-   `referee/`: Referee agent code and config.
-   `libs/`: Local clones of SDK repositories (do not commit contents of libs if they are submodules, but here we just cloned them).
-   `AGENTS.md`: This file.

## Current Status
-   Project initialized.
-   SDKs installed in `.venv`.
-   Setup scripts (`run.py`, `authenticate.py`, `init_db.py`) placed in agent directories.
-   Configuration templates created.
